					<h2> About the project May 2021 - June 2022</h2>
					<p> 
						The SCARA Arm was a collaboration bewtween me and my friend Adin. I sought to hone in my mechanical designing skills whilst he wanted to learn more about Brushless motors and FOC technology. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Today the SCARA Arm sits inside of UCSD's Envision Makerspace, and poses as an example of what makers can do if they put their heart to it. 
					</p>
				
					(insert image of it at envision)


					<h2> Robot arm design selection</h2>
					<p>
						We had really wanted to make a robot arm but there were multiple different types to choose from. During the research phase we settled on a SCARA Style Arm. This is because the arms on
						a generic robot arm has to fight against gravity and exert an incredible amount of torque on its joints to hold it's position. Undoubtedly, choose the correct design based on our materials
						and tooling was the most important part as it outlined the obastacles that we would have to face later on. 
					</p>
					
					<h2> Motor Design </h2>
					<p> 
						We went with these surprisingly cheap <a href = "https://emaxmodel.com/products/emax-gb4114-brushless-gimbal-motor-hollow-shaft-42kv-85t" target = "_blank" style = "color: white"> Emaxx 4114 gimbal motors</a> (while they were in stock) 
						and were 8$ each. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						The actual motor design has to be the best representation of the collaboration between me and Adin. We needed a housing to protect the motor controller, constrain the diametric magnet for the encoder, 
						and provide suitable mounting points to use the motor in multiple instances in our robot arm.
					</p>

					<p> 
						The final design is really compact and does a great job of housing the motor. It has a snap on lid which protects and gives tool free access to the pcb.
						It also has mine and Adin's logo on it!
					</p>

					<h2> Design Prototypes </h2>
					<h3> First Version </h3> 
					<p> 
						At first, I strived for pure simplicity. Attaching each motor directly to each joint of the arm. This looked fine in CAD but in real life, the LEAN from the sheer weight of each motor 
						was unbearably bad. Not only that, but the massive rotational intertia caused many other problems like shaking and slow movement.  
					</p>

					<h3> Second Version </h3>
					<p> I realized through an interesting belt-arrangement, the exact same robot arm could be achieved with belts. It moved the COG (center of gravity) much closer to the center of rotation and hugely decreased the rotational inertia </p>

					<p> This design was good enough to get the arm moving.</p>

					<p> 
						This version used fine pitched GT2 Belts, the same ones that 3D Printers use since I easily had those on hand. Unfortunately, it did not handle torque extremely well and the 3D 
						printed pulleys were prone to constant stripping.
